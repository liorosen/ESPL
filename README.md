ESPL (Embedded Systems Programming Lab)
Overview
This repository contains a series of laboratory exercises for the Embedded Systems Programming Lab (ESPL) course. The labs are designed to provide hands-on experience with low-level programming, focusing on C and Assembly languages, and to deepen understanding of computer architecture and embedded systems.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into several directories, each corresponding to a specific lab exercise:

LAB-1-main: Introduction to basic C programming and simple input/output operations.
LAB-2: Exploration of pointers, memory allocation, and data structures in C.
LAB 3: Tasks related to system calls, process management, and basic Assembly programming.
LAB 4: Advanced topics in Assembly language, including interfacing with C code.
LAB_A-main: Focus on bitwise operations and manipulation of data at the binary level.
LAB-B: Implementation of simple algorithms and their optimization in C.
LAB-C: Study of interrupt handling and real-time processing in embedded systems.
LAB D: Development of a small-scale embedded application integrating previous concepts.
LAB E: Final project involving comprehensive application of course topics.
