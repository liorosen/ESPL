## **ESPL (Embedded Systems Programming Lab)**
**Overview**
This repository contains a series of laboratory exercises for the Embedded Systems Programming Lab (ESPL) course. The labs are designed to provide hands-on experience with low-level programming, focusing on C and Assembly languages, and to deepen understanding of computer architecture and embedded systems.

**Repository Structure**
The repository is organized into several directories, each corresponding to a specific lab exercise:<br>

1. LAB-1-main: Introduction to basic C programming and simple input/output operations.<br>
2. LAB-2: Exploration of pointers, memory allocation, and data structures in C.<br>
3. LAB 3: Tasks related to system calls, process management, and basic Assembly programming.<br>
4. LAB 4: Advanced topics in Assembly language, including interfacing with C code.<br>
5. LAB_A-main: Focus on bitwise operations and manipulation of data at the binary level.<br>
6. LAB-B: Implementation of simple algorithms and their optimization in C.<br>
7. LAB-C: Study of interrupt handling and real-time processing in embedded systems.<br>
8. LAB D: Development of a small-scale embedded application integrating previous concepts.<br>
9. LAB E: Final project involving comprehensive application of course topics.<br>
